# Python Basics Practice

This repository demonstrates my understanding of Python fundamentals.
It contains small scripts that solve basic algorithmic tasks using clean and readable code.

## What I practice here
- working with lists and dictionaries
- loops (`for`)
- conditionals (`if / else`)
- functions and parameters
- indexes and enumeration
- basic problem solving

## Files
- `find_max_min.py` — finds maximum and minimum values in a list with their indexes
- `count_repeats.py` — counts how many times each element appears in a list
- `show_indexes.py` — analyzes a list, shows indexes, parity, sum and max value

## How to run
```bash
python filename.py
